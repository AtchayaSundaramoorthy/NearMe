Thirumullaivoyal is a western neighbourhood of Chennai, the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located in the Chennai Metropolitan Area in Tiruvallur district, 2 km (1.2 mi) from Ambattur. The neighbourhood is served by Thirumullaivoyal railway station and Annanur Railway Station. The region was historically part of Thondaimandalam, a region in Chola Empire during 9th century CE.

The place was originally called Mullaivanam, a forest, after which the suburb is named. The history of the suburb revolves around the Masilmaninathar temple. The place is also one of the five revenue firkas under the Avadi Taluk.[1] The place is a pilgrimage location and also houses several other religious and natural tourist destinations.
